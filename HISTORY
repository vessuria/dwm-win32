dwm-win32 is a port of the X11 window manager dwm to Microsoft Windows, created
by Marc Andre Tanner in 2009. He published dwm-win32-alpha1 to the suckless
mailing list (https://lists.suckless.org/dwm/0903/7775.html), and released a
second alpha shortly thereafter.

Many modifications and improvements have been made since by various
contributors, most notably Prabir Shrestha in 2020. Patches have been
selectively backported from his fork.

This project is currently maintained by Vessuria, adding multi-monitor support
and updating the software for newer Windows versions.
